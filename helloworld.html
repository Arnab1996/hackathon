										<h3> ['>battery goes all day playing games and watching videos without needing to be charged.', ">the moto g5 plus frequently lags and hangs up.  having owned  a moto g4 this is a huge disappointment.  i don't have games or memory hogging apps on my phone, i run stock android i update when presented.  my wife still has a moto g4 and more often than not i need to use her phone when we are together.  i have reset my phone,  experimented with disabling google, you name it i am frustrated. i used to tell everyone about moto g phones,  i will never buy motorola again.", ">i wish that i could give this a 10. i brought the lunar gray 4gb/64 gb standard version this is a perfect phone for anyone wanting quality without breaking the bank. it's an unbelievable value for the price. i've used it for a few weeks. it's speedy and responsive. most importantly, the battery last all day for me.", '>had an amazing battery life initially, but after installing a few apps, the phone barely makes it through the day. installed an app to find the culprit. no luck, 90% of the time is used by , google play service, totally opaque.', '>i love it!!!!!', ">i got this after being burned by a defective htc 10 that failed days after its warranty expired and the provider refused to bend.  this is a great phone at twice the price.  i love the card slot as i can put a ton of movies and tv shows on it for work.  the battery holds enough charge to watch all my shows for the 10 hour shift with power to spare.  plenty of processing power as i've never been able to slow it down with the games or apps i have installed.  i could care less that the screen resolution is 1080--it still looks great and is very bright.  the camera is not as sharp as the one on my htc 10 but it does the job.  i encountered the same problem talking on the phone as others have but i disabled enhanced 4g lte mode as found on lenovo forums and there is issue is gone.  (i blame verizon for this more than anything)  bottom line: best phone for the price.", '>love my new phone - feels good, works well, was easy to figure out.', ">pretty happen with my purchase.  someone stole my axon 7 @ edc and got a lg stylo 3 which i was very unhappy with - some weird glitch that filled the phone space up with system memory and slowed everything down and wouldn't let me install anything w/o wiping it (had to do this twice)..<br/><br/>this phone so far after a few days is a refreshing upgrade to the stylo..  much more space, quicker, cleaner os, shake and spin functions are simple and work well, etc, etc.<br/><br/>plus the amazon bloat wear's really very tolerable.  you're actually able to just delete the amazon icons if you don't want them and honestly i only recall an amazon add pop up once or twice so far...", '>this phone has been great since i bought it.  it has met my expectations. i recommend it.  i showed it to a co-worker who is going to buy one.', '>nice phone..but the wifi will drop and reconnect every now and then ..', '>received phone yesterday and have no idea what to do with it as instructions say put in sim cards and none are in pkg. i cannot understand why we are given such tiny incomplete instructions made for and by nerds!', ">super performance at a very low cost. camera is not a flagship camera, but it is good enough for what it is. low light sucks but it's good enough. everything else about the phone is amazing, battery life is unreal, easily get a full day from normal compulsive phone usage.", ">phone started smoking afraid if i charge it, it'll blow up<br/>i wanted to try to get support but said it isn't elligible", '>great amount of space and fast enough processor for everyday needs. good camera but not so great incoming call volume.', '>first impressions. more to follow after i have used it some.<br/><br/>caveat: notice that there is a sim card access key in a tiny easy to miss envelope in the box.<br/><br/>just got this to run on mint (a budget gsm mvno) as my other phone was a locked tracfone (with an integral sim) and their coverage has become very spotty in areas where before it was fine (i travel a lot: tx-nc-va-ny-in-ks-co so need decent national coverage.).<br/><br/>no removable battery so cannot rip it out to rapidly kill phone when those rare occasions occur; tho, there are features (motion and fingering) to help with a quick silencing.<br/><br/>glad i got the protective elastomer case as phone case material could not be more slippery were it greased. thin, nice heft, and feels good in the hand with the protective elastomer case. brilliant high def screen. motorola has done well with many handy features. got the cheaper amazon version with their lock screen ad and a plethora of their apps which has not proven to be a cost saving albatross; thus, worth the $35 savings.<br/><br/>has a "finger" print  sensor lock/unlock feature that works well.  notice the quotes around finger are there because a thumb print works, too.<br/><br/>working well as a mini-tablet.<br/><br/>more on actual use after i get the sim and use the phone for a while. ok, got the sim. this is the first time i have done this and it was not intuitive in the least! firstly, i was amazed at how hard i had to push the key into the sim card access hole to get the card holder to "pop" out! secondly, there are no decent instructions showing where to put and how to orient the sim card. this is how i did it: 1- power off the phone, 2- release the sim card holder by firmly pushing the key into the hole in the holder thus causing the ejection trigger to push the holder up out of tbe case, 3- after releasing the holder with the key, hold the phone as though you were going to look at the screen with the sim port on the top edge of the phone case, 4- as you slide the sim card holder out the sim card lays on top of the holder immediately inside it with the card notch on the lower right hand side and the sim circuit board surface facing up, 5- push the sim card holder back into the phone case until it latches, 6- power on the phone, 7- follow the sim card provider instructions for activating the phone. phone usage comments after a short period of local usage to follow.', '>all the smartphone features my wife and i wanted and needed--at a great price! believe the reviews!<br/>only issue was verizon sales staff and technicians who concluded that the phone was "not supported" during a lengthy second visit to the verizon-owned shop. however, the problem was not the phones but verizon\'s clunky payment system.<br/>when verizon personnel inserted sim cards at our first visit, account data showed both phones to have balances (left over from our old plans) greater than $60. but, the verizon payment system did not recognize these balances with the result that neither phone worked (as a phone) until we deposited more money into each account!<br/>frustrating. our only hint of the source of the problem was a verizon notification to one phone that the account would expire in five days unless money were added. a recurring notification to the other phone simply said that all systems were busy and to try again later.<br/>after adding money to both  accounts and being delighted with the phones, we returned to the shop a third time to inform all that the phones are fully supported.<br/>no one at the shop could do anything about accounting issues for our prepaid plans. online chats with the accounting people resulted in account balances being restored, a free gig of data added for two months to one phone, and a free prepaid month added to the other.', ">not very loud, is my only complaint. i've had it 3 months and that's it. great battery life, super fast recharge. fingerprint scanner is fast &amp; awesome ,  never misses. has all the features i could use on my galaxy s6 except nfc. even though this phone has less ram than the s6, it's faster at everything. i really like it.", '>fantastic', '>i love it!', '>a lot of phone for the price!', '>reception is very poor. calling party hears your phone ringing but phone actually does not ring, nor does it get registered as a missed call. secondly, people keep complaining that they can hardly hear you even though phone volume is high and you are talking at top of your voice. i tried two phones considering it might be that the first device i got might be having issue, but experienced same issue even with the 2nd new device i got.', ">two stars mainly due to the numerous constant ads.  i got the one where you can save money by putting up with ads.  we all make mistakes.  the phone seems to work good, its no nice samsung model.  however, for the money it is a good buy, a 4 star.  but..........do not make the mistake of getting the phone with the ads.  you don't just swipe them away.  they keep coming back like a swarm of roaches.  before long you will be wishing very much you could rid yourself of them at any cost.  annoying is to put it mildly.  that is my next project.  cost is no objective at this point.", ">i love this phone.  all the issues people have with them, regarding email notifications , phone calls not popping up but a notification in the top of the screen...sound issues....are all under a fixable setting.  just google it.  played pokemon go for 7-8 hours straight, raiding and catching, with screen brighteness up a little bit.  the phone waslittle warm, no lag and battery was at 19 percent when i got home.  that's heavy use.  i also under moderate use get over 24 hours of use.<br/><br/>before you judge the phone based on people's reviews that are regarding things they have no clue what they are doing.  google it.  i read all the reviews . this phone is beast.  the only downside is the speaker i wish was louder.  o well.", ">just received my phone.  charged it fully.  i left it for two days, untouched, and noticed that the battery had drained to 40%.  not sure if it's just my phone that is defective or if moto phones don't hold their battery life.  either way, i'm returning the phone.", '>it is incredibly fast.', '>the power button is too sensitive but otherwise it is a great phone.', '>great phone, great price.', '>easy setup, worked flawlessly, an excellent product all round. the turbo charger is amazing. using the fingerprint button for one button navigation is great feature. i love my moto !', '>would be better for me if the notification tones were louder', ">just received today, seems like a nice phone although it's heavier than i expected. i had to purchase a smaller (micro) sim card for it. one thing i've noticed with my last couple of motorola phone is that you have to do quite a few updates right out if the box. i'm really glad now that it go the phone with 64gb memory.", '>perfect', '>the phone works great. it is heavier than the moto g 4 model. the material seems to be more sturdy too.', ">great phone battery last for days i just finished day 3 and still have 68 % battery granted i don't have many apps. i know if you load<br/>office 365 app it really drains the battery. i am not on my phone all the time either i am rarely using it, but i don't shut if off or plug it in either.<br/>takes a nice photo in macro", '>thanks!', ">i bought this phone, having really liked the ease of use of the moto g4 plus and the moto x before that.  the software updates turned my g4 plus into a piece of trash that could occasionally make phone calls. so i bought this one with the firm resolve not to install any updates. so far i've kept to my oath (with the exception of some security update it needed right out of the box...dumb), and i've had pretty much zero issues. my biggest complaint is that there is now way to mute or block the update alerts.  i've had a software update alert popping up on my phone for a few weeks now that i've managed to ignore, but it seems impossible to permanently mute without rooting my phone and potentially bricking it...", '>excelente producto', ">this does not play well with verizon, but after jumping through many hoops and such, it is up and working - just no way to restore my old texts or call history.  i did manage to get my contacts, which was more important, so i'm satisfied.  i love the phone.  the only issue was it playing with the verizon network.", '>great online reviews, great little phone', '>good phone.<br/>better price.', ">buy this phone guys and gals.  don't question it, its an iphone 7s at one third the price.  it kicks ass, with super power and performance all round.", '>reception is very poor. calling party hears your phone ringing but phone actually does not ring, nor does it get registered as a
